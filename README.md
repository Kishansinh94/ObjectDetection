# ObjectDetection
## File description

# EfficientDet
- This project is about object detection. It detects the position of tumor in Brain MRI images. 
- Google AI's State-of-art object detection model used to carry task
- EfficientDetFile with name is to train used to trained model. 
- Model trained on Google colab with tensorflow 2 API for object detection. 
- The folder also contained saved model which can be used for detection on other images (You need to install tensorflow api for that)


# YOLOv3
- This project is about also object detection. Same as EffiientDet, it also detects the position of tumor in Brain MRI images. 
- One of the best know for object detection is Yolo family and amongst them YOLOv3 used here.
- File with name is to "train" is for trained model. (Need to install darkent for training) 
- Model trained on Google colab using darknet as backbone. 
- Saved model can be used for detection on other brain mri images withou any other installation (even without GPU detection will work smoothly).

# Transfer learning
 - This is about trasnfer learning used for classification of Brain MRI into two category: with tumot and without tumor using VGG16 based on Imagenet
 - Folder contains training file without dataset (which is available on github)
